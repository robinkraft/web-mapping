#Final Project

**Due date: March 5 by 5pm. Be prepared to present your project in class.**

**Keep in mind:  I will be entirely offline From February 26 to March 4**, and won't check email until the morning of March 5. So I won't be able to give you any last-minute help.

**What:** Create a map **using two or more data sets**. Embed the map inside a public "how I built it" blogpost.

As an example, [I wrote this blogpost](https://blog.mapbox.com/santa-rosa-fire-map-how-i-built-it-ef2483f5b92e) about my [fires map](https://robinkraft.github.io/norcal-fires-imagery/compare.html). Yours can be shorter, but be sure to answer these questions:

1. What does the map show, and why did you choose to make it?
2. Who is the map for, and why?
3. What data sets did you use? Link to the original sources.
4. What steps did you take to create the map? Include SQL queries, analyses, and design considerations.
5. What feedback did you get while making the map, and how did that change the map?
6. Do you have any reflections on the data, tools, or process of making your map?
