# Final Project

**Due date: Submit your blogpost URL by March 5 at 5pm. Be prepared to present your project in class.**

**Keep in mind:  I will be entirely offline from February 26 to March 4**, and won't check email until the morning of March 5. So I won't be able to give you any last-minute help.

**What:** Create a map **using two or more data sets**. Embed the map inside a public "how I built it" blogpost. I recommend using [Medium.com](https://www.medium.com) - you can easily embed your map there ([instructions](https://medium.com/@andrewxhill/how-to-add-maps-to-a-medium-post-8e881f99c56d)).

**Grading:** I will evaluate your map and blogpost based on the creativity and quality of the project and analysis, execution of the map visualization, and quality/detail of the writeup. Your post should be more than a paragraph or two, and should address each of the questions below in essay form (i.e. not in a question/answer format). Some questions can be answered together in one paragraph, others may merit their own sections.

1. What does the map show, and why did you choose to make it?
2. Who is the map for, and why? What story does it tell?
3. What data sets did you use? Why? Link to the original sources.
4. What steps did you take to create the map? Include SQL queries, analyses, and design considerations.
5. What feedback did you get while making the map, and how did that change the map?
6. Do you have any reflections on the data, tools, or process of making your map?

As an example, [I wrote this blogpost](https://blog.mapbox.com/santa-rosa-fire-map-how-i-built-it-ef2483f5b92e) about my [fires map](https://robinkraft.github.io/norcal-fires-imagery/compare.html). Yours does not have to be that long!
