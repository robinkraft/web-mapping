# Final Project

**Due date: Submit your blogpost URL by March 5 at 5pm. Be prepared to present your project in class.**

**Keep in mind:  I will be entirely offline from February 26 to March 4**, and won't check email until the morning of March 5. So I won't be able to give you any last-minute help.

**What:** Create **at least one map using two or more data sets** and Carto/PostGIS [spatial operators](http://postgis.org/docs/reference.html#Spatial_Relationships_Measurements) (e.g. ST_Within, ST_Intersection, etc.). Embed the map(s) inside a public blogpost - **include a "how I did it" section**. I recommend using [Medium.com](https://www.medium.com) - you can easily embed your map there ([instructions](https://medium.com/@andrewxhill/how-to-add-maps-to-a-medium-post-8e881f99c56d)).

**Grading:** I will evaluate your map and blogpost based on the creativity and quality of the project and analysis, execution of the map visualization, and quality/detail of the writeup. Your post should be more than a paragraph or two, and should address the considerations below in essay form (i.e. not in a question/answer format). Think of this as a map-based essay that includes a methods section.

**Examples:**
* [This is an excellent example](https://carto.com/blog/looking-at-the-l/) of a map-based essay from the former Chief Scientist at Carto.
* In class we saw [this great map story](https://nation.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=de7f932e3a1d494f9c9d9a67fb0de646) about housing affordability. [Here is the technical writeup](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2017/09/11/how-to-make-this-crazy-map/).
* [I wrote this blogpost](https://blog.mapbox.com/santa-rosa-fire-map-how-i-built-it-ef2483f5b92e) about my [fires map](https://robinkraft.github.io/norcal-fires-imagery/compare.html).

### Structure
You can go wild with structure so long as you tell a good story with your map(s) and include a "how I did it" section. But here's one way you could structure it:

**The story** - context for the reader
1. What are you writing about and mapping? Why does it matter? What are you trying to analyze?
2. Who would be interested in this?
3. How do your maps explain/illustrate whatever you're trying to get across to your audience?
4. What conclusions can we draw from your analysis and map?

**The how-to**
1. What data sets did you use? Why? Link to the original sources.  
2. What steps did you take to create the map? Include SQL queries, analyses, and design considerations.  
3. What feedback did you get while making the map, and how did that change the map?  
4. Do you have any reflections on the data, tools, or process of making your map?  

The [L Train](https://carto.com/blog/looking-at-the-l/) and [housing affordability](https://nation.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=de7f932e3a1d494f9c9d9a67fb0de646) stories are really great examples of how far you could go with this.
