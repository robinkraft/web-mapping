This code repository serves as the course website for ENVM-680 Spring 2018, **Web-based geospatial analysis**.  The class will provide students with a working knowledge of web-based mapping for a range of applications.  We will rely on the [Carto](http://www.carto.com) platform.  Students will have the opportunity to create maps and learn about programmatic ways to query large-scale geospatial data, embed maps in blogs, and other modern techniques for analyzing and sharing geospatial information.
